# Python-api-challenge

Hello this is my submission for the module 6 challenge. 

# Background 

For WeatherPy.ipynb:

In the WeatherPy.ipynb the goal of the challenge was to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.
Using the OpenWeatherAPI I was able to retrieve that data then I made a series of scatter plots showcasing the relationships of latitude vs. temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed. I then saved those 4 scatter plots and labeled them Fig1 - Fig 4.
I then made another series of scatter plots to find the linear regression for each relationship. I did this by seperating the plots into Northrn and Southern Hemisphere then like in the previous scatter plots compared the relationships between latitude vs, temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed. But since I was doing for both Northern and Southern Hemisphere I came out with 8 scatter plots displaying the linear regression, model's formula and r values. I also made comments on any correlations or findings I saw.

For VacationPy.ipynb :

In the VacationPy.ipynb using the Jupyter notebooks, geoViews Python Library, and the Geopapify API I made plans for a future vacation. 
So I created maps that dsiplay a point for every city using the dataframe. One map shows the the cities with difference in size based on humidity. Now adding special weather conditions we displayed anohter map showing points on the map where there are hotels and the country based on the specific weather conditions and if they are within 10,000 meters of the selected coordinates.
